# Lighthall Data Analytics Super League

I have joined the Data Analytics Super League repository to test my knowledge in Data Analytics.

The Data Analytics Super League (DASL1) is a multi-level project-based competition, where you can tackle data analytics challenges to build your portfolio of projects and gain experience working in teams, while qualifying for job opportunities.

HOW DOES THE SUPER LEAGUE WORK?

The Super League has 5 levels of challenges - 2 individual challenges and 3 team challenges. Challenges will be launched on Wednesdays and submissions are due on Sundays.

With each level, the projects get more challenging. You will have access to mentors and support at each stage, but it won't be easy to make it as a finalist to the 5th level.

Please note that none of the challenges are in any way related to Lighthall's product. All projects will be your intellectual property, which you can add to your portfolio and present to any company when recruiting.

WHO SHOULD APPLY?

While we welcome data analysts from all levels, a minimum level of experience would be useful to get the most out of these fast-paced challenges. That said, there will be mentors and peers to help out and guide.

WHEN DOES IT START?

DASL1 will kick off on May 3rd for its first challenge. Each Tuesday, we will announce the participants who advance to the next stage of the competition. On June 6th, we will hold a virtual event to showcase the best projects and announce all finalists in a grand finale.
