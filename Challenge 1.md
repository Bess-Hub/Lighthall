# Challenge 1
# Cell Referencing

Using Cell Referencing, write a formula that calculates and auto-populates a multiplication table into cell B2.
Use the fill handle in cell B2 to drag the formula across the entire multiplication table so it can auto-populate the cells.

See example below:

Replace the word ‘FORMULA’ in cell B2 with the correct formula that calculates the product of values in cells B1 and A2 then drag the fill handle to auto populate the rest of the cells in the multiplication table.

NOTE: Just one formula is needed and it is based on your knowledge of cell referencing.
Your submission should be a link to a Google Spreadsheet or a One Drive link to the Excel Spreadsheet.

# Answer

This challenge tests some basic Excel skills that requires knowing how to work with variable or fixed reference.

The objective is to have the output cell multiplying the value of column A (fixed reference) at the same row as the the output cell (variable reference) by the value of the same column (variable reference) row A (fixed reference).

For that we can use the $ symbol.

So we can type this formula in cell B2
<quote> =$A2*B$1 </quote>

And just drag it across the multiplication table to auto-populate the cells.
